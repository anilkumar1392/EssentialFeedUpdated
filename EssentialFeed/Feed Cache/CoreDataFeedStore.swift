/*
 In coreData data model leaves in main production bundle.
 Which is differnect than the test bundle.
 So it is essential we choose the correct bundle.
 So we injected the bundle when testing in production.
 
 Pointing the store at /dev/null
 The null device discards all data directed to it while reporting that write operations succeeded.

 By using a file URL of /dev/null for the persistent store, the Core Data stack will not save SQLite artifacts to disk, doing the work in memory. This means that this option is faster when running tests, as opposed to performing I/O and actually writing/reading from disk. Moreover, when operating in-memory, you prevent cross test side-effects since this process doesnâ€™t create any artifacts.
